# IITK-Mini-MIPS üöÄ

A Verilog-based single-cycle MIPS-like processor built as part of a computer architecture project at IIT Kanpur. The **IITK-Mini-MIPS** supports integer and floating-point instructions, with dedicated instruction and data memory, general-purpose and floating-point registers, and a modular hardware design.

---

## üß† Objective

To design and implement a custom MIPS-like processor supporting a simplified Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), using Verilog HDL. The processor is capable of executing arithmetic, memory, branch, and floating-point instructions in a single cycle per instruction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- **ISA**: Custom, MIPS-inspired 32-bit RISC architecture
- **Registers**:
  - 32 General Purpose Registers (GPR)
  - 32 Floating Point Registers (FPR)
- **Memory**:
  - Separate Instruction and Data Memory
  - 32-bit word size
- **Execution**: Single-cycle instruction execution
